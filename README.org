* repl-nvim
- a plugin for running code as repl in terminal
* Plugin Dependencies and Installation
- Telescope and its dependencies
  - Note that telescope is neovim 0.5 + only
    - so build your neovim from source, or get the latest release!
- Here is an example using [[https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug][vim-plug]] here
  - but feel free to use whatever plugin manager that you like!
- REPLs:
	- python or python3
	- cling (C++)

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
" for terminal integration
Plug 'ThePrimeagen/harpoon'

"For this plugin
Plug 'Josiah-tan/repl-nvim'
#+END_SRC
* Setup
- This setup function is important for initializing the plugin, any default options can be set here
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
-- no defaults by default
require("repl-nvim").setup()
-- use a custom virtual environment
require("repl-nvim").setup({
	python = {
		source = "/path/to/env/here/activate"
	},
})
#+END_SRC
* Builtins
- This plugin has several builtin features that you can utilize (using python as an example) 
- Feel free to substitute "python" with "cpp" or other languages (TODO)
#+BEGIN_SRC vim
" initializes terminal with repl environment (otherwise it will be lazily initialized)
nnoremap <leader>jq <cmd>lua require("repl_nvim.builtin.python").replInit(4)<cr>
" sends visually selected text to the repl terminal
vnoremap <leader>x <cmd>lua require("repl_nvim.builtin.python").runReplSelection(4)<cr><esc>
" sends sends text between two line separators "##" above and below the region of text to be executed in the repl terminal
nnoremap <leader>x <cmd>lua require("repl_nvim.builtin.python").runReplBlock(4)<cr>
" executes the current line without indentation in the repl terminal
nnoremap <leader>xl <cmd>lua require("repl_nvim.builtin.python").runReplLineNoIndent(4)<cr>
#+END_SRC 
- This code here only works for python files as of right now (not sure what they would mean for C++ but maybe I'll do something for it later)
#+BEGIN_SRC vim
" executes current file in a virtual environment if available, otherwise run into the global environment
nnoremap <leader>sv <cmd>lua require("repl_nvim.builtin.python").sourceVenv(1)<CR>
" pip installs packages into your virtual environment if available, otherwise install into the global environment
nnoremap <leader>si <cmd>lua require("repl_nvim.builtin.python").sourceInstallModules(1)<CR>
#+END_SRC
